# SIPify a classic telephone

This code is used to turn a classic US telephone with a numeric keypad
and a real bell into a SIP phone based on a Raspberry Pi.  The analog
electronics that generate the TouchTone frequencies are removed and
the keyboard is connected to GPIO pins.  The bell is operated through
a GPIO pin that controls 20VDC generated by a boost converter.  The
handset is connected to a USB sound card.
